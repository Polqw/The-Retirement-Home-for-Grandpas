# The-Retirement-Home-for-Grandpas

Our app is going to be a game of sorts. The game will be trying to keep grandpa's happiness bar up. He will have needs. There will be a store where purchases are held. There will be categories that the items purchased will be under(Using objects inside arrays). If grandpa likes it, the bar changes accordingly. It is going to be timed. The only way to raise the timer is to give grandpa stuff.
